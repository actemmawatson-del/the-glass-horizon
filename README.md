🎯 Slide 2: Logline

> In a near-future world where memories can be reprogrammed through neuro-holography, a brilliant neuroscientist discovers that her past — and identity — have been artificially engineered. As she begins to unravel a corporate conspiracy, her sanity may be the price for the truth.


📖 Slide 3: Synopsis

Dr. Lila Carr is the architect of MirrorMind, a groundbreaking neural imaging system that lets patients access lost or suppressed memories via synthetic reconstruction. But when she begins receiving fragmented visions of a young girl she's never met — memories the system extracted from her own mind — Lila is forced to question everything she knows.

As the tech begins to malfunction on a global scale, Lila’s search for answers leads to an abandoned cognitive lab, a missing test subject, and a buried past involving her own childhood and a shadowy experiment in neural reality control.

Set against a hauntingly sterile future, The Glass Horizon explores identity, grief, and the consequences of turning consciousness into code.
